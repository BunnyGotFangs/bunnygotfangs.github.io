                    I am continually <em>amazed</em> at the beautiful, delicate <a href="http://en.wikipedi-a.org/wiki/Linum_lewisii" rel="external" title="Learn more about Blue Flax">Blue Flax </a> that somehow took hold in my garden. They are awash in color every morning, yet not a single flower remains by the afternoon. they are the very definition of ephemeral.
